# **Eye Donation Awareness**

* The main aim of this project is to create awareness about Eye Donations
* Developed a website using HTML, CSS and JavaScript.
* We not only deployed a website about eye donation but also engaged with Eye Banks and Hospitals, gathering
information from them, and interacted with various people to raise awareness.
* The website provides information about eye donations and guiding users with the Eye Donation process.
